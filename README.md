# Weather_Data_Pipelines
This project involves creating three data pipelines to optimize delivery routes using distance and weather data. The pipelines will pull data from various weather APIs, process it, and store it in a PostgreSQL database. The data pipelines are designed to be scheduled to run daily, updating the database with current and forecasted weather data.
